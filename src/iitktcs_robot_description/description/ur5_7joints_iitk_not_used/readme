This urdf file was generated to plan for UR5 using single joint to control suction.

We added this joint to motion plan. Hence, now we have to plan for 7 joints.

But we failed in joint trajectory action. The ur_modern_driver uses follow_joint_trajectory action
working with 6 joints. But moveit now was generating trajectory plans for 7 joints.

We have to figure out how to remap from 7 joints follow_joint_trajectory action to 6 joints
follow_joint_trajectory action
